###### Version 1.0

Play: [Beef](https://yetifunk.github.io/beef/)

## Description

Beef is a browser based card battling game akin to Magic the Gathering or Pokemon, but instead of fantasic elves or wild creatures, you will be battling it out with over 30 different rappers from the Old School to the New. The player and the computer take turns either attacking their opponent or defending their crew.  Both offensive and defensive action success is based on chance, with defensive strategies having almost twice the success rate of attacks. These successes or failures are determined on a card by card basis.  If any card's hitpoints drops to zero or below, they are removed from play.  After 16 total moves (the current round length), an end game statistics page is shown and a winner announced.  This condition is decided by a final score that is based on damage dealt, defense applied and opponent cards "killed."

## Motivation

As a big hip-hop head, this idea came pretty naturally.  I wanted to make a simple game utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript but packing a whole bunch of flavor and personality.  While the initial version of this game is very simplistic, I do have plans to continue developing the game and adding more features.

## Technologies Used

Beef was built in Visual Studio Code using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

All assets were created in GIMP by the author.

## Future Version Goals

- Deck expansion
- Special Moves
- Card Targeting System
- Animations for dealing and flipping of cards
- Add a buy round where new cards can be aquired
- Lengthier gameplay, multiple rounds.
